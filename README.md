# TaskLabelConsensus
Boost label accuracy with TaskLabelConsensus! ðŸ“Š Tailor consensus thresholds, consider worker expertise &amp; task time for precise task labelling. Optimize tasks today! 

Features:

**Consensus Method**: Our project offers a consensus method that takes into account the answers provided by workers and calculates a consensus label based on a user-defined threshold (default: 50%). This method promotes robust labeling decisions by aggregating multiple worker responses.

**Worker Experience Analysis:** The project provides an insightful analysis of how worker experience impacts the accuracy of predicted labels. By categorizing workers based on the number of completed tasks, you can gain a better understanding of the reliability of their contributions.

**Threshold Variation:** We understand that different tasks may require varying levels of consensus. With our project, you can experiment with different consensus thresholds to determine the optimal setting for your specific use case.

**Time-Based Evaluation:** If task completion times are available, our system incorporates this data to evaluate the relationship between task completion time and label accuracy. This information can guide task assignment strategies.


**Usage, Results and Discussion:**

Please refer to the Setup:Report.pdf

Limitations:

**Limited to Binary Labels:** The current version of the project focuses on binary labels. Future iterations could expand to handle multi-class labels.

**Assumes Honest Workers:** The method assumes that workers provide honest answers. Dealing with malicious or low-quality workers is not covered in this iteration.
